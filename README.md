# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Homeworks

Solutions I've written in relation to the homeworks I was given in the DSA class. Each task has it's own README.md which contains a short description of the task, followed by the original requirements, written in Bulgarian.

Please notice that all of the tasks have to gather their information by reading files in the directory of the program, as the tasks require.
